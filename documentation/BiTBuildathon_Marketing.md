## Awareness (Pre-Launch Stage) *most relevant stage to us currently
**Focus:** Brand awareness and product visibility
*Need to have a solid understanding of brand message and positioning*

1. **Determine A Release Date** 
   - Be mindful of Current events; don’t want to overshadow the release
   - IOS, Android, Google, etc. app release requirements

   - **Pain points:**
     - PII in multiple locations
     - Lack of resources/knowledge
     - Need to have multiple apps for similar things
   - **Target audience:** women 18+ who suffer from chronic pain due to reproductive health conditions, like endometriosis, infertility, or fibroids

3. **Create User Personas**
   - **Scenarios:**
     - Mariah is a sexually active 19 year old college student living in Jackson, Mississippi. She already knew she had PCOS but due to a recent pregnancy scare she decided she needs a period tracker to help her stay on top of her irregular periods. With her busy schedule, she finds it hard to keep track of her period and her sexual encounters simultaneously
     - Keta is a 27 year old Call Center Specialist living in Sarasota, Florida. She recently started experiencing pain in her lower back and pelvic area, even when not on her period. She decides to visit a doctor where she learns that she has fibroids and now she just wants an app that can help her understand and manage her condition in a simple way. She has had desk jobs most of her career and now she is concerned this may affect her performance at work.
