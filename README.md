**EmpowHer Health** is an app to empower women to take control of their reproductive health through syncing nutritional and fitness habits to their monthly cycles. EmpowHer will feature tools to allow users to log their meals, workouts, cycle, and any symptoms. Additionally, it will provide suggestions tailored to each users’ menstrual cycles.
EmpowHer will also feature an AI component that allows the users to ask specific questions related to their reproductive health. This component will empower users to prepare effectively for doctors’ appointments allowing them to better advocate for themselves. Our goal is to provide women with the ultimate toolkit to help understand and optimize their reproductive health.
