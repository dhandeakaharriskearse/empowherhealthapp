## Problem Statement

Countless women grapple with the reality of chronic pain due to reproductive health issues, yet face a fragmented landscape where their health data is scattered across various platforms and medical records. This disconnection presents a formidable obstacle in achieving a holistic understanding of their health, hindering their ability to make informed decisions and manage their conditions effectively. Such challenges are further amplified for Black and Latinx women, who encounter additional layers of difficulty due to disparities in health literacy, access, and culturally competent care.

## About Our App: Balanced

Balanced is an app built to help women over 35 take control of their reproductive health by bringing all their health data into one place. It combines information from nutrition and fitness trackers, menstrual cycle monitors, and medical records to offer a complete view of how lifestyle affects their reproductive health. By using AI, Balance makes it easier to understand this data and provides personalized recommendations.

## Impact Assessment

Information is often a pivotal gateway to healthcare access, acting as both a map and a key for patients navigating their health decisions and care pathways. Yet, for Black and Latinx women, this information often seems to be locked behind doors to which they are not given the key. The research underscores a critical gap in health literacy and awareness that disproportionately affects these communities. Health organizations strive to elevate public understanding of various reproductive health issues, but the distribution and accessibility of this information are uneven. Cultural and linguistic barriers, along with systemic healthcare disparities, complicate the picture further, preventing these women from accessing the comprehensive and culturally competent information they need. This gap in information not only impedes their ability to make informed health decisions but also poses a significant barrier to accessing necessary healthcare services, ultimately affecting their overall well-being.

Black and Latinx women remain disproportionately burdened with issues relevant to women's health, such as endometriosis — a prevalent and painful condition that is often underdiagnosed and misunderstood. The complexity of endometriosis, characterized by a wide range of symptoms and a lack of a singular diagnostic method, means that timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial. However, the research highlights that these women are more likely to experience delayed diagnoses and inadequate treatment, exacerbating their pain and suffering. This disparity isn't just about physiological health; it extends into their quality of life, fertility, and mental health, illustrating a broader issue of inequity within the healthcare system. These disparities are not merely statistical anomalies but are indicative of a systemic failure to address the unique health needs of Black and Latinx women, further entrenching the health inequities they face.

The dual burden of being less likely to be supported with information while also remaining disproportionately burdened with women's health issues underscores a significant problem for women's rights broadly. This situation encapsulates a failure of the healthcare system to provide equitable care and information access to all women, particularly those from marginalized communities. For women's rights to truly advance, addressing these disparities head-on is crucial — ensuring that all women, regardless of race or ethnicity, have equal access to the information, care, and support they need to make informed decisions about their health. This intersection of healthcare disparity and women's rights is a critical battleground for equity and justice.

Balanced, with its innovative approach to consolidating health data, is a beacon of empowerment for women's health rights, particularly for Black and Latinx communities who have historically faced systemic barriers to accessing comprehensive healthcare information. By integrating various aspects of health monitoring into a single platform, Balanced not only simplifies the management of reproductive health issues like endometriosis but also addresses the critical gap in health literacy and awareness. Its AI-driven personalized recommendations offer a tailored solution that respects the unique needs of each user, potentially transforming the way women, especially those from marginalized groups, navigate their health care. In doing so, Balanced does more than just offer a technological solution; it actively contributes to breaking down the walls of inequity in healthcare access, shining a light on the path towards a more inclusive and equitable healthcare system where every woman has the information and support she needs to make informed decisions about her health. This approach not only supports individual health journeys but also underscores a broader commitment to advancing women's rights by ensuring equitable access to health information and care, challenging the systemic disparities that have long hindered progress in women's health equity.

## Hypothesis and Assumptions

**Assumption:** We believe that women want access to a comprehensive view of their of information about their nutrition and fitness trackers, menstrual cycle monitors, and medical records.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that if users understand their health data and receive personalized recommendations based on the fluctuations of their cycle they would feel more empowered to take care of their sexual and reproductive health.

## How It Works

**Data Integration:** Balance leverages API (Application Programming Interface) integration to aggregate data from various health-related applications (like Flo or Health) and EHR (Electronic Health Records) systems (via potential partnerships with companies like Epic). This centralized data aggregation approach allows users to have a holistic view of their health metrics in a single interface.

**Predictive Analytics:** Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, Balance analyzes the user's health data to provide predictive insights. This includes generating personalized nutrition suggestions based on the menstrual cycle phase and automating symptom tracking through SMS prompts, enhancing user engagement and health monitoring.

**AI Interaction:** The app features a conversational AI interface, enabling users to interact with the system in natural language to ask health-related questions. This AI system is trained on a vast dataset of reproductive health information to provide accurate, personalized responses.

**Educational Resources:** Balance curates high-quality, evidence-based content on reproductive health, utilizing NLP (Natural Language Processing) to recommend articles and resources tailored to the user’s specific health phase and concerns.

**Nutrition and Symptom Logging:** The app incorporates image recognition technology powered by AI to identify foods from photos, making nutritional logging intuitive and efficient. Symptom logging is facilitated through an easy-to-use interface that tracks and analyzes menstrual health over time, leveraging data analytics to identify patterns and offer insights.

## Scope & Features

The project scope for Balanced, an innovative health app, is designed to empower women over 35 by providing a comprehensive solution to manage their reproductive health through the integration of various health data sources. This initiative aims to address and mitigate the challenges associated with the fragmentation of health information, which often complicates the health management process, particularly for those dealing with chronic conditions like endometriosis. By focusing on this target demographic, Balanced seeks to fill a critical gap in health literacy and access, with a keen focus on inclusivity, especially for Black and Latinx women who face disproportionate challenges in this area.
